# SDK


A N-Gage Sdk existed and even had multiple version but it was not obtainable without a contract with Nokia. The N-Gage being a part of the s60 phone series, there is a chance we could use / gain some information from the s60 sdk.
The Reference and the install guide of the N-Gage sdk are available (see "Documentation")

# Firmware

The last version of the firmware seems to be 4.03. Here is a link of available downloads found from the net but nothing has been tested:
