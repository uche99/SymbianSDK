# SDK


A N-Gage SDK existed and even had multiple version but it was not obtainable without a contract with Nokia but the the reference and the install guide of the N-Gage sdk are available (see "Documentation"). The N-Gage being a part of the s60 phone series, there is a chance we could use / gain some information from the s60 SDK.

# Firmware

The version 4.03 is the most available version to download. Versions 4.10 and 4.11 also seems to exist but have problems ([source](http://my-symbian.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19466))

Here is a link of available downloads found from the net but nothing has been tested:
